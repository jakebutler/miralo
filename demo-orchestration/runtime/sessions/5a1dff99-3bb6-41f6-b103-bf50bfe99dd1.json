It already supports list creation and task state changes, making it a good target for validated UX refinements in onboarding, prioritization, and completion flow.",

      "Detected 0 app route page(s) in Next.js app router.",
      "State management appears to use Redux Toolkit.",
      "Tailwind CSS is configured for rapid UI iteration.",
      "Todo data persistence appears to rely on browser localStorage.",
