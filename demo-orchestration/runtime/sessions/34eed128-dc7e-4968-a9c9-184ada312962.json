    "summary": "This repository is a focused todo application built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, leveraging Redux Toolkit for state management and localStorage for client-side persistence. It is designed for rapid UI iteration and interview-driven development, featuring a concise codebase with a limited number of routes and files. The product appears to prioritize core task completion but may benefit from improved onboarding, workflow efficiency, and user feedback mechanisms.",
