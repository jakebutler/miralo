## Page Copy

### Above The Fold (Hero)
**Eyebrow:**  
Validated Interview-to-UI Loop

**Headline:**  
Turn live interview feedback into demo-ready UI changes.

**Subheadline:**  
Miralo detects validated feedback, selects the right worktree, and delivers UI-only iterations with before/after proof and deterministic validator artifacts.

**Primary CTA:**  
Open Live Demo

**Secondary CTA:**  
See Before/After Flow

**Trust line under CTAs:**  
READY_TO_SHOW appears only after a recorded clickthrough and screenshot are generated.

### Proof Strip (Above Fold Companion)
**Section title:**  
Proof, Not Promises

**Card 1:**  
Validated Feedback First  
Miralo acts only after confirmation-style signal detection, not raw transcript noise.

**Card 2:**  
Before / After by Design  
Compare baseline and iterated UI paths to show exactly what changed.

**Card 3:**  
Deterministic Demo Artifacts  
Every iteration can be backed by a validator video and screenshot.

### How Miralo Works
**Section title:**  
From Conversation to Confident Change in 3 Steps

**Step 1 title:**  
Capture and Validate the Signal

**Step 1 body:**  
Stream the interview, detect summary-plus-confirmation beats, and isolate feedback that is ready to act on.

**Step 2 title:**  
Select a Safe Iteration Path

**Step 2 body:**  
Choose or create a worktree with clear rationale and keep changes inside UI-only guardrails.

**Step 3 title:**  
Ship Proof for Review

**Step 3 body:**  
Run deterministic clickthrough validation and generate artifacts before showing the result.

### Differentiators
**Section title:**  
Why Miralo Feels Different in a Demo

**Point 1 title:**  
Signal-Gated Decisions

**Point 1 body:**  
Validated feedback drives changes, so the iteration story is grounded in what users actually confirmed.

**Point 2 title:**  
Scoped by Guardrails

**Point 2 body:**  
UI-only constraints keep iterations focused, faster to verify, and safer to demonstrate live.

**Point 3 title:**  
Traceable by Default

**Point 3 body:**  
Decision logs, worktree rationale, and validator outputs create an auditable loop from transcript to result.

### Final CTA Band
**Section title:**  
Show the Next Product Iteration While the Conversation Is Still Fresh

**Body copy:**  
If your team can hear it, validate it, and see it in the interface within the same session, you move faster with more confidence.

**Primary CTA:**  
Open Live Demo

**Secondary CTA:**  
Open Demo Todo

## Annotations
- **Hero headline:** Uses outcome-first framing to communicate transformation immediately, following clarity-over-cleverness.
- **Subheadline:** Includes concrete mechanisms (validated feedback, worktree, UI-only, artifacts) to avoid vague AI claims.
- **Primary CTA ("Open Live Demo"):** Action plus immediate value; optimized for judge flow and minimal friction.
- **Proof strip label ("Proof, Not Promises"):** Reinforces credibility and differentiates from generic AI landing page language.
- **3-step workflow:** Reduces perceived complexity while preserving technical depth.
- **Final CTA copy:** Repeats core outcome in plain language and builds urgency without hype.

## Alternatives

### Headline Options
- **Option A:** Turn live interview feedback into demo-ready UI changes.  
  **Rationale:** Most direct expression of outcome and speed.
- **Option B:** Validate what users mean, then show what changes.  
  **Rationale:** Emphasizes trust and visible transformation.
- **Option C:** From interview signal to before/after proof in one workflow.  
  **Rationale:** Highlights end-to-end system and demo evidence.

### Subheadline Options
- **Option A:** Miralo detects validated feedback, selects the right worktree, and delivers UI-only iterations with before/after proof and deterministic validator artifacts.  
  **Rationale:** High-specificity, technical credibility.
- **Option B:** Stop collecting interview notes that go nowhere. Miralo turns confirmed user feedback into showable interface improvements with evidence.  
  **Rationale:** Strong pain-to-outcome arc.

### Primary CTA Options
- **Option A:** Open Live Demo  
  **Rationale:** Lowest-friction judge path.
- **Option B:** See Miralo in Action  
  **Rationale:** Slightly broader tone while keeping action-oriented wording.
- **Option C:** Run the Demo Loop  
  **Rationale:** Emphasizes process and interactivity.

## Meta Content
- **Page title:** Miralo | From Interview Feedback to Demo-Ready UI Iterations
- **Meta description:** Miralo turns validated interview feedback into UI-only iterations with before/after proof, decision logs, and deterministic demo artifacts.

## Launch-Strategy Addendum (Demo Day ORB-Lite)
- **Owned:** Use the landing page plus live `/miralo` walkthrough as the main conversion path.
- **Rented:** After judging, publish one short clip from validator artifacts to a single social channel.
- **Borrowed:** Anchor presentations around proof artifacts and before/after narrative so third-party audiences can trust the story quickly.
